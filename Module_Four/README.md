Module #4 Make resources more available and easier to use. Summary: Build a responsive application that would allow a homeless person quickly find resources near them that have availability and contact information. Too often people are trying to find resources calling around town from shelter to shelter to find a solution. We have a dataset available to you from “Unity” - Community Point. This lists all of the Associations that are Part of THHI and information avalible from http://unity.bowmansystems.com/index.php. The county has already made some initial attempts to add the details to a GIS map. https://maps.hillsboroughcounty.org/human/human.html. Which works great from a desktop but doesn’t translate well from a mobile prospective. 

•Goal: Build a native or responsive application that uses the existing data and wraps it into a application that can cache data for offline use. This app could also provide features for both community members and the homeless population at large. 


•Goal: Reimagine the Community Resource guide for mobile use. The current system is difficult to search when on a mobile device. Help people find the resources they need. 


•Goal: Easyshare What is the easiest way to share this application with people who need it? QR Code, SMS, a phone number that you can call that sends you a txt message. Or maybe a number you txt that sends you txt with the web address or link to download the app. 


•Goal: TXT Me information To make these services more available let's build a phone tree that will allow someone to call in select their need put in their zip code and then will send you a text message of a location with address and phone number. (and possibly a link to app above)
